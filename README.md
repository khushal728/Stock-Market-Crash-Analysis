# Stock-Market-Crash-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes historical stock market crashes using Sensex data. It identifies major crash periods (1997, 2008-09, 2020), calculates daily returns and drawdowns, and visualizes market trends to enhance understanding of market volatility and resilience.

## 📊 Key Features

In-Depth Stock Market Crash Analysis: Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy, Plotly) to process historical Sensex data, calculate daily returns & drawdowns, and identify crashes based on -5% daily drops and -20% drawdowns.

Interactive Visualizations & Early Warning System: Built dynamic Plotly dashboards to visualize Sensex closing prices, daily returns, and drawdowns. Developed a synthetic 2025 dataset with an early warning system using 10-day rolling mean returns (< -0.5%) and volatility (> 2%).

Advanced Time Series Clustering: Created a clustering algorithm to detect and analyze contiguous crash periods, visualizing 30-day windows around key crashes for deeper insights.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Plotly

Visualization: Interactive dashboards with Plotly

Time Series Analysis: Rolling windows, drawdowns, clustering
